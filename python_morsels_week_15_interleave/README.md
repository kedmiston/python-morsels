CHALLENGE Email (7/9/2018):

Hey!

See if you can figure out at least one of the bonuses for this week's exercise if you have time.

I want you to write a function that accepts two lists and returns a new iterable with each of the given items
"interleaved" (item 0 from iterable 1, then item 0 from iterable 2, then item 1 from iterable 1, and so on).

Here's an example (which returns lists):
>>> interleave([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])
[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]
I want you to assume that the lists have the same length.  Don't worry at all about what to do with different length
lists.  We'll actually handle that in a future exercise.

As a bonus, I'd like you to make your function accept any iterable, not just lists/sequences ✔️:
>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> interleave(nums, (n**2 for n in nums))
[1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 4, 16]
For a second bonus, return an iterator (for example a generator) from your interleave function instead of a list. ✔️
>>> interleave([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])
<generator object interleave at 0x7f6174c18b48>
>>> list(interleave([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]))
[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]
This should allow your interleave function to accept infinitely long iterables (or other lazy iterables).

Automated tests for this week's exercise can be found here. You'll need to write your function in a module named
interleave.py next to the test file. To run the tests you'll run "python test_interleave.py" and check the output for
"OK". You'll see that there are some "expected failures" (or "unexpected successes" maybe). If you'd like to do the
bonus, you'll want to comment out the noted lines of code in the tests file to test them properly.

Hey!

If you haven't attempted to solve interleave yet, close this email and go do that now before reading on. If you have
attempted solving interleave, read on...

If we want to loop over two lists at the same time, you might think to use range(len(...)) to look up corresponding
items as you loop:
def interleave(sequence1, sequence2):
    """Return iterable of one item at a time from each list."""
    interleaved = []
    for i in range(len(sequence1)):
        interleaved.append(sequence1[i])
        interleaved.append(sequence2[i])
    return interleaved
But this isn't very idiomatic.

Whenever you see range(len(...)) you should probably consider using enumerate(...) instead, which gives us both an
index and items from the iterable we're looping over:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    """Return iterable of one item at a time from each list."""
    interleaved = []
    for i, item in enumerate(iterable1):
        interleaved.append(item)
        interleaved.append(iterable2[i])
    return interleaved
But this also isn't the most idiomatic way to solve this problem.

We're using indexes here to loop over two lists at the same time. Python actually has a built-in zip function for
doing exactly that:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = []
    for item1, item2 in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        interleaved.append(item1)
        interleaved.append(item2)
    return interleaved
IThe zip function gives us back an iterable which provides tuples of two items as we loop over it.  We're unpacking
the items into item1 and item2 and then appending each to the new list.

If you ever find yourself wanting to loop over multiple lists at once, don't reach for enumerate or indexes in general,
reach for zip.

If you're not familiar with zip or enumerate and their uses, you might want to read (or re-read) this article on
looping in Python with indexes.

Let's talk about the first bonus.

Bonus #1
For the first bonus we were supposed to accept any iterables to our function, not just lists or other sequences.

When we were using indexes to loop over two sequences at the same time, that would have been a problem. But now that
we're using zip, our function actually already passes this first bonus. The zip function doesn't use indexes to loop
over multiple items at once, it's a bit more sophisticated than that.

So the solution we already have works:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = []
    for item1, item2 in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        interleaved.append(item1)
        interleaved.append(item2)
    return interleaved
You might think could we use a list comprehension for this? After all, we've got an empty list and a loop and we're
appending and.

This does look like something that could be turned into a list comprehension but we have a problem: we have two append
calls! If we want to get closer to being able to copy-paste our way into a list comprehension, we could do this:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = []
    for item1, item2 in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        for item in [item1, item2]:
            interleaved.append(item)
    return interleaved
We now only have one append in our loops.

If we copy-paste this into a list comprehension, we'll get this:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = [
        item
        for item1, item2 in zip(iterable1, iterable2)
        for item in [item1, item2]
    ]
    return interleaved
Notice that this list comprehension has two for clauses. This isn't two list comprehensions nested inside each other,
it's one list comprehension with nested for loops in it. Also notice the order of the for clauses. That order is
important and it's hard to remember unless you copy-paste your way into a comprehension from for loops. If you need a
refresher on list comprehensions, read this article on list comprehensions.

You might realize that we could actually rewrite this a bit.

We could do this instead:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    return [
        item
        for pair in zip(iterable1, iterable2)
        for item in pair
    ]
Here we're returning our list right away instead of assigning it to an unnecessary and unhelpful variable. We're also
capturing the response from zip into an items variable instead of unpacking the items into two values and then
repacking them to loop over each.

We'll look at one last solution for this bonus.

Instead of using a list comprehension, we could take the items from zip and extend our list using the list extend
method or the += operator:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = []
    for items in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        interleaved += items
    return interleaved
When you see an empty list being appended to over and over in a for loop, you should think of list comprehensions. When
you see "some_list.extend(an_iterable)" or "some_list += an_iterable", you won't be able to convert that to a list
comprehension directly. We need to unroll that in order to copy-paste our way into a comprehension.
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = []
    for items in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        for item in items:
            interleaved.append(item)
    return interleaved

Bonus #2
Let's attempt about the second bonus now.

For the second bonus we were asked to return an iterator (a lazy iterable) from our function instead of a list.

We could make a lazy iterable instead of a list by turning our list comprehension into a generator expression. We can
do this by replacing the square brackets with parentheses:

def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    return (
        item
        for pair in zip(iterable1, iterable2)
        for item in pair
    )
This function returns a generator object instead of a list.

If we decided we didn't like that extra loop, we could use itertools.chain:
from itertools import chain

def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    return chain.from_iterable(pair for pair in zip(iterable1, iterable2))
I've collapsed this generator expression to a single line here because it's short enough that it's not particularly
difficult to read this way.

Also note that we don't have two sets of parenthesis around this generator expression, one for the function call and
one for the generator expression inside. Python actually allows us to remove extra parenthesis for generator
expressions when they're the only thing inside a function call.

This isn't a great solution though. Mostly because we don't actually need this generator expression.

We could instead do this:
from itertools import chain

def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    return chain.from_iterable(zip(iterable1, iterable2))
Whenever you see a generator expression that doesn't change anything or filter anything, remove it. That generator
expression was pointless because we can just loop over the original iterable instead.

If you're curious about chain.from_iterable vs chain, you can think of chain.from_iterable(iterable) as
chain(*iterable) except more efficient. More in the documentation on chain.

Another way to get our function to return a generator object is to create a generator function.

The easiest way to do that is to take our solution with two appends and replace the appends with yield statements.

Here's our two append solution:
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    interleaved = []
    for item1, item2 in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        interleaved.append(item1)
        interleaved.append(item2)
    return interleaved
We can replace the appends with yield statements and remove the list entirely.
def interleave(iterable1, iterable2):
    for item1, item2 in zip(iterable1, iterable2):
        yield item1
        yield item2
We don't need a list in that example because our generator function will return a generator that will yield new items
as it's looped over.

This is probably my favorite solution to this problem because I find it the most clear.

My next favorite solution is the last chain.from_iterable solution, which I find fairly clear as well.

I hope you learned something this week!
